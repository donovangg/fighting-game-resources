# iTechedThat Inspiration
Fighting games are hard. Tutorials in game kinda suck and a lot of teaching is left to the community.
The community has plenty of good resources for many different games but some are hard to find.
After looking for awhile on a r/streetfighter I realized, maybe other people are looking for this. It
would be cool if there was a single site for some cool stuff to check out.

I really enjoyed using file based routing with Next, styling with Tailwind and Supabase to get up and running for my backend. Next Auth takes care of the Google Auth and the Form that users submit goes to Formspree.

# Todo
