#iTechedThat: Fighting Game Resource hub
Fighting game resource hub submitted by the community.

#iTechedThat Inspiration
Fighting games are hard. Tutorials in game kinda suck and a lot of teaching is left to the community.
The community has plenty of good resources for many different games but some are hard to find.
After looking for awhile on a r/streetfighter I realized, maybe other people are looking for this. It
would be cool if there was a single site for some cool stuff to check out.

#Tech stack sandwich
I really enjoyed using file based routing with Next, styling with Tailwind and Supabase to get up and running for my backend. Next Auth takes care of the Google Auth and the Form that users submit goes to Formspree.

#Todo
--Pagination and sorting when more resources are submitted
--FGC Twitch featured section.
--Convert to Typescript.

#Running the project
Well this is a Next app so almost the same rules apply.

first clone this repo and install it on your machine.

Than its just a Next App:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
